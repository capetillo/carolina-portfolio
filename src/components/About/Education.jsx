        After graduating from the University of California, Santa Barbara with a 
        B.A. in psychology, I focused in cognitive neuroscience
        and the software engineering aspect of it. 
        I joined the Software Engineering 
        Immersive bootcamp at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/san-diego" target="blank" id="GA">
        General Assembly</a> in San Diego.  
        Not only did I learn how to code both individually and as a 
        group member, I also learned how to teach myself anything programming related.
