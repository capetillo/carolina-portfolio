        After graduating from University of California, Santa Barbara with a 
        B.A. in Psychology, I narrowed down my interest in Psychology to Cognitive Neuroscience,
        particularly the Software Engineering aspect of it. 
        I then joined the Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp at General Assembly in San Diego, 
        where I learned how to code individually and as a group member.
